Let g(n) be a function to calculate the total number of ways of attending classes over N days 
 so that they are eligible for attending the graduation ceremony.

 once the student is absent for 4 or more than 4 consecutive days then he will not be eligible for attending the graduation ceremony so we can take the base condition for consecutive day of absent from 0 to 3 consecutive days

f(n-1,0)=number of ways to attend class in the first n with 0 consecutive absent,d=0
f(n-1,1)=number of ways to attend class in the first n with 1 consecutive absent,d=1
f(n-1,2)=number of ways to attend class in the first n with 2 consecutive absent,d=2
f(n-1,3)=number of ways to attend class in the first n with 3 consecutive absent,d=3

To calculate the total number of ways of attending classes so student are eligible for attending the graduation ceremony.
I've derived to get a linear equation like this:

g(n)=f(n-1,0)+f(n-1,1,)+f(n-1,2)+f(n-1,3)

f(n-1,1)-->f(n-2,0)
f(n-1,2)-->f(n-2,1)-->f(n-3,0)
f(n-1,3)-->f(n-2,2)-->f(n-3,1)-->f(n-4,0)



#To calculate the The num of ways to miss the graduation ceremony.

Let k(n) be a function to calculate the  total number of ways of attending classes over N days so student can eligible for attending the graduation ceremony but they miss the graduation.

To calculate the no of ways that so that student will miss the graduation ceremony.

student will miss the graduation ceremony they You don't attend class on day n

i have derived this liner eqaution student did attend class on day n

k(n)=f(n-1,1,)+f(n-1,2)+f(n-1,3)
